/**
 * FILE: event-catalog.ts

 * PURPOSE: Shared event catalog used by the Events page and Events API. Keeping
 *          the catalog here prevents the UI and backend route from disagreeing
 *          about valid event ids, titles, statuses, and registration behavior.
 * USED BY: src/app/events/EventsClient.tsx, src/app/api/events route handlers
 * LAST UPDATED: 2026-05-11
